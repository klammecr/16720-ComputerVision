    "Load the corresponding test images and their labels, and compute the predicted labels of each, i.e., compute its distance to every image in training set and return the label with least distance difference as the predicted label. To quantify the accuracy, you will compute a confusion matrix $C$: given a classification problem, the entry $C(i,j)$ of a confusion matrix counts the number of instances of class $i$ that were predicted as class $j$. When things are going well, the elements on the diagonal of $C$ are large, and the off-diagonal elements are small. Since there are 8 classes, $C$ will be $8 \\times 8$. The accuracy, or percent of correctly classified images, is given by the trace of $C$ divided by the sum of $C$."
