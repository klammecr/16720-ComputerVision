    "### Multi-resolution: Spatial Pyramid Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Bag of words is simple and efficient, but it discards information about the spatial structure of the image and this information is often valuable. One way to alleviate this issue is to use spatial pyramid matching [2]. The general idea is to divide the image into a small number of cells, and concatenate the histogram of each of these cells to the histogram of the original image, with a suitable weight. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will implement a popular scheme that chops the image into $2^l\\times2^l$ cells where $l$ is the layer number. We treat each cell as a small image and count how often each visual word appears. This results in a histogram for every single cell in every layer. Finally to represent the entire image, we concatenate all the histograms together. If there are $L+1$ layers and $K$ visual words, the resulting vector has dimensionality $K\\sum_{l=0}^L{4^l} = K\\left(4^{(L+1)}-1\\right)/3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes the weighting scheme. Note that when concatenating all the histograms, histograms from different levels are assigned different weights. Typically (and in the original work [2]), features from layer $l$ gets half the weight of features from layer $l+1$, with the exception of layer 0, which is assigned a weight equal to layer 1. A popular choice is for layer $0$ and layer $1$ the weight is set to $2^{-L}$, and for the rest it is set to $2^{l-L-1}$ (\\eg, in a three layer spatial pyramid, $L=2$ and weights are set to $1/4$, $1/4$ and $1/2$ for layer 0, 1 and 2 respectively, see Fig. 7). Take level 2 as an example, there will be 16 histograms in total, each has a norm equal to one. You should concatenate these histograms, normalize this layer (multiply the concatenated vector by 1/16), and apply the 1/2 layer weight of level 2 on top of that. Note that following this operation, concatenating the weighted features of each layer will result in a final vector of norm equal to 1.\n",
